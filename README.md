Medical Image Analysis using Deep Learning
Medical Image Analysis plays an important role in the field of healthcare for various purposes such as early detection, diagnosis and treatment of diseases. Without the use of any technology, analysing medical images can be very challenging as well as time consuming. The use of technical advancements in the fields of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning can help solve these issues. Machine learning introduces techniques like supervised, unsupervised and semi-supervised learning for feature extraction. However, selection of a suitable feature for a particular problem requires a domain expert. Deep Learning is a part of Machine Learning which can be used to solve the problem of feature selection.
